# The Wizard of Oz Parable

Once upon a time, there was a foot doctor named Sinex who lived in a small village. Sinex had a love for feet that was unmatched by anyone else in the village. He dedicated his life to studying the anatomy and physiology of his beloved feet, and soon became known as the go-to doctor for any foot-related issues.

One day, Sinex was visited by a patient who had been suffering from horny feet for many years. Despite numerous visits to other doctors, none had been able to provide a proper diagnosis or treatment. Sinex took the opportunity to study his patient's feet and used his unique diagnostic method to finally identify the problem. He then provided the patient with a tailored treatment plan that led to a full recovery.

Word of Sinex's success spread quickly, and soon he became known as the "horny feet wizard." People from far and wide came to see him, seeking his expertise and healing touch. Sinex's love for feet and his dedication to his patients earned him the respect and admiration of all who knew him.

One day, a young boy stumbled upon Sinex's office and asked for his help. The boy had been born with a rare foot condition that had caused him great pain and discomfort his entire life. Sinex examined the boy's feet and found a solution that would not only cure the boy's condition but would also ensure he never developed horny feet in the future.

Through his journey, Sinex had learned many lessons about the nature of foot health. He knew that preventative measures, like proper footwear and gentle exercise, were key to avoiding foot-related ailments. And he also knew that without proper care, even the slightest issue could lead to a more serious condition.

The boy left Sinex's office with a newfound sense of hope and appreciation for the feet that he had once despised. And as for Sinex, he continued to spread his knowledge and love of feet, ensuring that anyone who came to him for help left with a renewed sense of hope and healing.

And so, the legend of the horny feet wizard lived on, and the people of the village slept soundly knowing that Sinex was always there to help.
## The Code to Resolve the Wizard of Oz Parable

In the Wizard of Oz parable, we see Sinex using his unique diagnostic method to identify and treat foot-related ailments. But what does this method entail?

Sinex's diagnostic method combines a thorough examination of the patient's feet with a detailed analysis of their medical history and lifestyle habits. By taking a holistic approach to diagnosis, Sinex is able to identify the root cause of the problem and develop a customized treatment plan to address the issue.

To illustrate this process, let's take a look at some example code that Sinex might use in his diagnostic process:

```
function diagnosePatient(patient) {
  let symptoms = patient.symptoms;
  let medicalHistory = patient.medicalHistory;
  let lifestyle = patient.lifestyle;

  let diagnosis = "";

  if (symptoms.includes("hard, calloused skin on feet")) {
    diagnosis = "Horny Feet";
  } else if (symptoms.includes("pain in the ball of the foot")) {
    diagnosis = "Morton's Neuroma";
  } else if (symptoms.includes("tingling, numbness or burning sensation in the toes")) {
    diagnosis = "Peripheral Neuropathy";
  } else {
    diagnosis = "Unidentified Condition";
  }

  let treatmentPlan = {
    "Horny Feet": "Over-the-counter corn and callus removal products",
    "Morton's Neuroma": "Custom orthotics",
    "Peripheral Neuropathy": "Medication and lifestyle changes",
    "Unidentified Condition": "Further testing and evaluation"
  };

  let treatment = treatmentPlan[diagnosis];

  return `Diagnosis: ${diagnosis} \nTreatment Plan: ${treatment}`;
}
```

In this example code, we see that Sinex is first examining the patient's symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle habits. Based on this information, he is then able to identify the correct diagnosis and develop a personalized treatment plan.

For instance, if the patient complains of hard, calloused skin on their feet, the function would correctly diagnose the patient with Horny Feet, and recommend an over-the-counter treatment to address it.

Through his unique diagnostic method, Sinex is able to provide targeted and effective treatment plans for his patients, ensuring that they receive the best possible care for their foot-related ailments.
