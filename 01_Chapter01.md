# Sinex and the Wizard of Oz Parable

Once upon a time, there was a foot doctor named Sinex. He was known throughout the land as the best in the business when it came to feet. His patients would travel from far and wide just to see him, and he never failed to amaze them with his knowledge and expertise.

But Sinex had a secret. You see, he had a particular fascination with feet. He loved to touch them, smell them, and even lick them. He knew it was wrong, but he just couldn't help himself. It was like an addiction, a compulsion that he couldn't shake.

One day, Sinex was sitting in his clinic, pondering his strange fixation. Suddenly, a tornado appeared and swept him up, carrying him away to a strange and magical land.

As he journeyed through this mysterious land, Sinex met many strange and wonderful creatures. There were wizards, witches, lions and tigers and bears – oh my! But no matter where he went, he couldn't shake his obsession with feet.

Finally, Sinex came upon a great and powerful wizard. The wizard asked him why he was fixated on feet, and Sinex confided in him about his strange and taboo urge to touch, smell and even lick his patient's feet. 

The wizard listened intently, then offered a bit of sage advice.

"Sinex," the wizard said, "you must understand that your love of feet is not inherently wrong. It is simply different from what society might expect. However, if you allow your love for feet to drive every aspect of your identity, you may find yourself traveling down a dangerous path. Embrace your fascination, but do not let it consume you."

Sinex took the wizard's words to heart, and from that day on, he made changes to his practice. He accepted that his love for feet was what made him a uniquely talented foot doctor, but he also set boundaries to ensure his patients' comfort and safety. He would never again let his fixation take control of his life.

And so, Sinex returned home from his journey with a newfound understanding of himself and his passion. He was still the best foot doctor in the land, but now he was also a wiser and more compassionate healer. He knew his patients and himself better than ever before, and he was ready to take on any challenge that came his way.

The end.
Throughout the Wizard of Oz parable, Sinex was struggling with his obsession for feet. However, he eventually learned to control his desires and channel his passion for feet into his work as a foot doctor. This required a change in behavior and a recognition of the values of his patients' comfort and safety. 

As a result, Sinex had to blend his love for feet with his medical expertise to provide high-quality treatment to his patients. To do so, he employed various strategies and tools. One of the main ones was the use of the latest technologies to diagnose and treat foot problems. Sinex is an expert in using different tools and technologies to help people keep their feet healthy and happy.

Furthermore, Sinex had to develop a better understanding of his patients' needs and ensure that his medical practices aligned with ethical standards. This involved taking steps to remain up-to-date on the latest research and education in the field of foot care, in order to provide accurate and timely treatment.

Sinex also followed strict protocols to ensure that all of his patients were treated with respect and dignity. He considered everything from the cleanliness of his clinic to the language he used when speaking with patients, to make sure that every aspect of their visit was comfortable and professional.

Lastly, Sinex worked hard to build a strong relationship with his patients, to earn their trust and provide the best possible care. This included effective communication, active listening, and an empathetic approach to each patient's unique situation.

In short, Sinex's transformation was not due to a code or a single solution, but rather an ongoing effort to improve his medical expertise and services, empathize with his patients' needs and establish himself as a trusted and reputable foot doctor.
